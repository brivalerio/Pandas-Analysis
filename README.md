*Heroes of Pymoli Challenge*<br/>
<br/>
For this exercise, we have a new job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company and has been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.<br/>
<br/>
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like a report generated that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.<br/>
<br/>

-Persons between the ages of 20 & 24 account for 44.79% of the player base.  They've purchased 365 items with a total value of $1,114.06, which is more than double the value of the second highest group. The second highest is the 15 to 19 age group at 18.58% of the base.
